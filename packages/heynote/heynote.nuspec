## General Information

- Website: [heynote.com](https://heynote.com)

- Changelog: [heynote.com](https://heynote.com/docs/changelog/)

Heynote is a dedicated scratchpad for developers. It functions as a large persistent text buffer where you can write down anything you like. Works great for that Slack message you don't want to accidentally send, a JSON response from an API you're working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc. 

The Heynote buffer is divided into blocks, and each block can have its own Language set (e.g. JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, etc.). This gives you syntax highlighting and lets you auto-format that JSON response.

Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://heynote.com/docs/) is available on the Heynote website.

## Development

To develop Heynote you need Node.js and you should (hopefully) just need to check out the code and then run:

```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

### Run Tests

To run the tests:

```
> npm run test
```

To run the tests in the Playwright UI:

```
> npm run test:ui
```


### Contributions

I'm happy to merge contributions that fit my vision for the app. Bug fixes are always welcome. 


## FAQ

### Where is the buffer data stored?

See the [documentation](https://heynote.com/docs/#user-content-the-buffer-file).

### Can you make a mobile app?

No, at the moment this is out of scope, sorry.

### Can you add a feature for naming blocks and/or adding tags? [(#44)](https://github.com/heyman/heynote/issues/44)

Currently, I'm not planning on adding this. The main reason is that it goes against the scratchpadness of the program.

I can totally see the usefulness of such a feature, and it's definitely something that I would expect from a more traditional Notes app. However a large part of Heynote's appeal is it's simplicity, and if that is to remain so, I'm going to have to say no to a lot of actually useful features.

### What are the default keyboard shortcuts?

See the [documentation](https://heynote.com/docs/#user-content-default-key-bindings).

## Thanks!

Heynote is built upon [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and other great open-source projects.
